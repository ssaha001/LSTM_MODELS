For running this python we will need to install the libraries mentioned in requirements.txt file.
    we can use this command:
        pip install -r requirements.txt
I have developed two different models.
In lstm_model.py, the month and year is combined into a single column.
But in lstm_model1.py, the month and year are separated into two different columns. 
To run any of the scripts, use this command
        python <name_of_the_script>
The loss of these predictions are huge. I think I will need to learn mode about LSTM models to get better results.
